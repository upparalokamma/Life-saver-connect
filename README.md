LIFE SAVOR CONNECT
DESCRIPTION
**Life Saver Connect** is a PHP-based web application designed to address emergency blood requirements in hospitals. When a patient needs blood, they can submit a request on the platform specifying their blood group. This triggers notifications to nearby blood banks and registered donors who match the required blood type. These donors, including individuals using the application, can then proceed to the hospital to donate blood. Additionally, the patient receives contact details of matching donors to facilitate direct communication. By bridging the gap between donors and recipients, **Life Saver Connect** plays a crucial role in saving lives during critical emergencies.
